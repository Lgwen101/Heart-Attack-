# Welcome to Heart-Attack Prediction Analysis

# About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) in which our goal is to establish a robust and accurate predictive model and to obtain insights into the underlying factors contributing to the risk of heart disease, allowing us to see what factors contributes more to the risk of heart disease.

# Problem Definition
Our goal is to establish a robust and accurate predictive model and to obtain insights into the underlying factors contributing to the risk of heart disease, allowing us to see what factors contributes more to the risk of heart disease.

# Models Used
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) SVC with RBF Kernel
5) SVC classifier with Sigmoid kernel

# Conclusion
- In this analysis, it's evident that Max Heart Rate, STSlope, and Chest Pain exhibit positive correlations with the occurrence of a heart attack.
- Conversely, Exercise induced angina, OldPeak, and the number of major vessels show negative correlations with our output variable.
- Logistic Regression: It achieved the highest accuracy among all the classifiers, indicating that it performed the best in terms of correctly predicting the classes in the test data.
- Support Vector Machine with Sigmoid Kernel: It exhibited the lowest accuracy among the classifiers tested. This indicates that the sigmoid kernel might not be the most appropriate choice for this particular dataset and classification problem

# What did we learn from this project?
- How to handle outliers in our Dataset
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Using CoCalc to work on our project simultaneously
- Different Machine Learning Models outside of our syllabus
- How to represent Data more effectively using different colour schemes
